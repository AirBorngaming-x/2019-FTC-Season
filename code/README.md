# ALERT
This is where the working version of our code is located. These files are the ones needed to run the robot for this season. Do NOT put code that has not been tested in this folder.

If you would like to upload work in progress code, this would need to be done in a test fork. Since we are still pretty new to Github, we will be using individual test folders. So, go to the root, find your name, and upload work in progress there. 

There should also be a "test" folder where it is the current, FULL work-in-progress for the robot. Again, ideally this would be in a test fork, but we do not need to worry about that right now.
